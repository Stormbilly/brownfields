# Snake - Refactoring Challenge
For those who don't know the game, search for it. 

We want to add a new feature to the game. A Tunnel, as an obstacle in the maze.
But the codebase is not really structured, we need to do a refactoring.

* Write Tests! As this is a valuable working product, we don't want to change existing behavior during the refactoring.
* Use the Mikado Method to create a Mikado Graph.
* Refactor step by step, introduce new Tests and commit each progress.
